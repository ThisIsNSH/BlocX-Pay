# BlocX Pay

### BlocX Pay allows users to easily use ETH as a mode of payment

#### What is BlocX Pay
It is an application based on top of ethereum blockchain . This application allows a user to transfer ETH to another user in a secure way through smart contracts in Solidity. It is a decentralized way of transferring ETH and moreover, it keeps a track of the transactions that are being processed along with the details of the sender and the receiver. It has a very sleek UI and is easy to operate. A user gets an account ID when he purchases ETH through which he can transfer the ETH to another user by putting their account ID. Through MetaMask , we get account IDs when we purchase ETH and a particular user can have multiple IDs. These IDs are often present in wallets and transactions can take place through those wallets. This application avoids the interference of any third party and makes it more secure.

#### Challenges we ran into
It was a lot of fun making this project. We were able to learn a lot from this project but while making it we ran into quite a few hurdles that we were able to overcome. First we didn't know about the tools through which we will be buliding the project . We started with "What is Blockchain?" at around 11am of Day1. Then "What exactly is Blockchain?". Then "Why do we need Blockchain?". Finding solution to these questions gave us the motivation to proceed. Always being into the fun mood we were on top of ethereum. But the major issue was "OUT OF GAS" xD. We almost spent hours finding out how can we fix this issue. Overall it was a learning experience.
